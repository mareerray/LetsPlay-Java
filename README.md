> Here’s a step-by-step plan to develop a basic CRUD RESTful API with Spring Boot and MongoDB for user and product management,including proper security and error handling measures as outlined.

# Project Outline
This application will feature user and product entities, provide RESTful CRUD endpoints, implement token-based authentication and authorization, and integrate security best practices for handling sensitive data and user interactions.

## Database Design
- User: Fields – id, name, email, password, role (admin/user)

- Product: Fields – id, name, description, price, userId (owner)

- Relationship: One user owns many products (“User 1–n Product”).

## API Development
- Implement CRUD endpoints for both users and products (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

- Ensure "GET Products" endpoint is accessible without authentication.

- Follow REST conventions for routes, resource URLs, and response status codes.

## Authentication & Authorization
- Integrate Spring Security for JWT (token-based) authentication.

- Role-based authorization: limit certain APIs to admins or product owners; others accessible to ordinary users.

- Restrict access according to user roles, enforce permissions on endpoints.

## Error Handling
- Implement global exception handlers to catch and manage errors gracefully.

- Map exceptions to relevant HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 401, 403, 404) and custom error messages.

- Prevent any 5XX errors by thorough validation and error management.

## Security Measures
- Password Handling: Hash & salt passwords before saving (use BCrypt or similar algorithm).

- Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks on MongoDB.

- Sensitive Information: Never expose password or other private fields in API responses.

- Enforce HTTPS for secure API calls; configure your environment accordingly.

## Bonus Features
- CORS: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to control allowed domains for API access.

- Rate Limiting: Add request rate limiting (e.g., via Bucket4j or Spring RateLimiter) to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Testing & Deployment
- Validate endpoints for correct authentication/authorization and accurate CRUD functionality.

- Test that all security and error handling requirements are met, including the absence of 5XX errors.

- Provide clear run instructions or a startup script for auditors to launch and test the project.

## Resources
- Use Spring Initializer to bootstrap the project.

- Reference Github REST documentation for API conventions.

## Security Notice – HTTPS Enforcement

This application only supports HTTPS connections out of the box, configured via the `application.properties`:
- Keystore: `src/main/resources/keystore.p12`
- SSL is enabled: `server.ssl.enabled=true`

Use a valid, trusted certificate for any public deployment.
