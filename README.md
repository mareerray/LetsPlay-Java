## Objectives
Develop a secure, robust, and RESTful CRUD API using Spring Boot and MongoDB.
The app supports user management and product management with full authentication, authorization, error handling, and security controls.

## Features
- User Management: Register, login, view/update/delete users, admin role support.

- Product Management: Create, read, update, delete products.

- GET Products API is open (no authentication required).

- Role-Based Access Control: Only authorized users/admins can access protected resources.

- Token-based Authentication: Powered by JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- Secure Password Storage: Hash/salt passwords before saving.

- RESTful Principles: All endpoints and behaviors are consistent with REST conventions.

- Comprehensive Error Handling: All errors are gracefully mapped to proper HTTP codes.

## Setup & Running
### Requirements
- Java 17+

- Maven

- MongoDB (local or cloud/Atlas)

- HTTPS-capable browser or API client (Postman, curl)

### Quickstart
### 1. Clone Repository

````
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd letsplay-java
````

### 2. Configure MongoDB URI in application.properties
````
spring.application.name=letsplay
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/test
spring.security.user.name=maire
spring.security.user.password=maire123
jwt.secret=your-very-secret-key

server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=password
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
server.ssl.keyAlias=tomcat

spring.mvc.throw-exception-if-no-handler-found=true
spring.web.resources.add-mappings=false
````
### 3. Place your SSL keystore

- Be sure keystore.p12 is present in src/main/resources

- If you need one, generate with:

````
keytool -genkeypair -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 3650
````

### 4. Build and Run

````
mvn spring-boot:run
````

- Access your API at: https://localhost:8080/

(Note: Browsers and Postman may warn about untrusted or self-signed certificate; you can safely accept this for testing.)

## Authentication & Authorization
- Users authenticate using JWT tokens (supplied as Authorization: Bearer <token>)

- Role-based access:

    - user role: Can access/modify own resources

    - admin role: Full access to all resources

---
## Security Measures

- All traffic uses HTTPS for security.

- Passwords are hashed and salted using BCryptPasswordEncoder.

- Input validation: Strict validation with @Valid, custom DTOs.

- No sensitive data (passwords, secrets) returned in any API response.

## Error Handling
All errors are handled globally and consistently, with informative JSON responses and appropriate status codes.

| Error/Condition       | 	HTTP Status	 | Example                                            |
|-----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Not Found             | 	404	         | User/Product does not exist                        |
| Unauthorized          | 	401          | 	JWT missing/invalid, login required               |
| Forbidden             | 	403          | 	Accessing/changing another userâ€™s product or info |
| Conflict              | 	409          | 	Registering duplicate user or product             |
| Validation Error      | 	400          | 	Missing/wrong fields                              |

## Testing & Auditing
- Automated tests for all endpoints and error scenarios recommended.

- Auditors can run the project using Maven and test with Postman/curl as shown in the setup.

- CORS, rate limiting, and additional features are available for further enhancement 
and can be added for production deployments or advanced security policies.
