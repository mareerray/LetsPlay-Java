> After analyzing the content and standard Spring REST practices from your controllers, there are several distinct error/exception scenarios that should be reported to the client. Here are the key error conditions you should display (directly or via your global exception handler):

## UserController
- User not found (e.g., invalid email for authentication, or not found by ID)

- Unauthorized (invalid credentials, user not logged in, wrong JWT, or trying to access another user's info)

- Conflict (user with email already exists during registration or admin user creation)

- Validation errors (request body doesn't meet @Valid, missing fields, bad format, etc.)

- Forbidden (modifying users/roles you don't have permission for, e.g., assigning roles)

- Resource not found (updating or deleting user that does not exist)

- Generic/other server errors (rare, fallback)

## ProductController
- Product not found (invalid product ID for get, update, or delete)

- Unauthorized (JWT missing, user not logged in)

- Forbidden (not owner/admin when modifying/deleting/updating product)

- Validation errors (bad or missing fields on create/update)

- Generic/other server errors (rare, fallback)
